Reddit bot that responds to the word ("good bot") in the body of a comment and responds with ("Good User!")


Please use this as a template to create unique Reddit bot's please do not use this as a tool to spam Reddit.

# Instructions

**I**: Create a Reddit API key

**II**: Enter your Reddit API information into the given boxes the code should be commented to indicate where if my fucking lazy ass did it after I finished this read me. If not it's probablly pretty obvious if you just read the code.

**III**: Run the python script in an instance of IDLE or just run the command:
> python botname.py

**IV**: Upload your unique bot to Github and make your code opensource so people can improve and learn :')
